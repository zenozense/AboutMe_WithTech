  <p>
  <p>I'm a student majoring in Information Technology at <a href="http://www.htc.ac.th/webroot59">Hatyai Technical
      College</a>, and I'm currently busy preparing for university. My first exposure to computers was at 6y/o, thanks
    to my older brother. <br>I was immediately fascinated by how these strange machines worked, and my curiosity
    sparked a
    lifelong interest in exploring technology.<br><br>As I grew older, my interest in technology only deepened. I
    devoured articles on computers, programming, and the internet. I spent hours in front of the computer,
    experimenting with new software, learning new programming languages, and have fun with my friend<br><br>My passion
    for technology led me to
    choose a major in Information Technology at Hatyai Technical College. I'm now in my second year of studies, and I'm
    excited to start future majors in university.<br><br>I believe that technology is the key to solving many of
    the
    world's most pressing problems. I'm eager to use my skills and knowledge to make a positive impact on the
    world.<br><br>I hope you enjoyed my story!
